--------

xsData is a complete XML data binding library for python allowing developers to access
and use XML documents as simple objects rather than using DOM.

It ships with a code generator for XML Schema definitions and WSDL 1.1 with SOAP 1.1
bindings. It produces simple dataclasses with type hints that don't depend on the
library itself in order to reduce the learning curve for users that have to write the
binding models manually.

The included parser is highly optimized and adaptable with 4 available handlers based
on native python and lxml. The parser configuration offers the ability to skip unknown
properties and to process xinclude statements.

The parser and serializer are constantly tested against the
`W3C XML Schema 1.1 test suite <https://github.com/tefra/xsdata-w3c-tests>`_ and
passes more than 99% of the valid instance cases.
