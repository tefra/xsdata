==================
Samples Repository
==================

You can find a collection of schemas and examples in the sample
`repository <https://github.com/tefra/xsdata-samples>`_.

Most of these collections came from bug reports and they represent some of the most
interesting and complex production level cases I have come across, showcasing the
code generator and binding capabilities of xsdata.
