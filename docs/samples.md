# Samples

**Samples Repository**

You can find a collection of schemas and examples in the sample
[repository](https://github.com/tefra/xsdata-samples).

Most of these collections came from bug reports, and they represent some of the most
interesting and complex production level cases I have come across, showcasing the code
generator and binding capabilities of xsdata.

**W3C XML Schema Suite**

xsdata is constantly tested and measured against the
[W3C XML Schema 1.1 test suite](https://github.com/w3c/xsdtests). Because of the size
and time it takes to run, the test runner is on it's own
[repo](https://github.com/tefra/xsdata-w3c-tests>).

The suite is quite extensible and consist of more than 14k valid tests cases for both
XML and JSON Binding.
